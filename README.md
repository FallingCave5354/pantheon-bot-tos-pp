## Terms of Service

### 1. Acceptance of Terms
By inviting, adding, or using the Pantheon Realms Bot (the "Bot") and its associated features (including linking your Minecraft account via DiscordSRV), you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service. If you do not agree to these terms, please do not use the Bot or its account-linking features.

### 2. Service Description
The Bot is provided to facilitate the synchronization of data between the **Pantheon Realms** Minecraft server and the Pantheon Realms Discord server. Its primary functions include:
* Linking Discord accounts to Minecraft accounts.
* Synchronizing in-game ranks with Discord roles.
* Forwarding chat messages between the game server and Discord channels.
* Whitelisting/allowing access to the Minecraft server based on Discord status.

### 3. Account Linking & Security
To access specific features on Pantheon Realms, you may be required to link your Minecraft account to your Discord account.
* **Responsibility:** You are responsible for maintaining the security of your Discord account.
* **Authorization:** By running the linking command, you authorize the Bot to associate your Discord User ID with your Minecraft UUID.
* **Unlinking:** You may unlink your account at any time using the designated commands, though this may result in a loss of access to the Minecraft server or specific in-game perks.

### 4. User Conduct
You agree not to use the Bot to:
* Exploit, reverse-engineer, or attempt to crash the Bot or the Pantheon Realms server.
* Spam commands or abuse the linkage system to evade bans.
* Violate the Discord Terms of Service or Community Guidelines.

### 5. Availability & Termination
* **No Guarantee:** The Bot is provided "as-is." We do not guarantee 100% uptime or that account synchronization will be instant or error-free.
* **Termination:** The administrators of Pantheon Realms reserve the right to ban your specific User ID from using the Bot or unlink your accounts at their sole discretion, without prior notice, if you violate these terms or the server rules.

### 6. Limitation of Liability
Pantheon Realms and its developers shall not be held liable for any damages arising from the use or inability to use the Bot, including but not limited to loss of in-game items, rank desynchronization, or data loss.

## Privacy Policy

### 1. Information We Collect
To function correctly, the Bot (powered by DiscordSRV) collects and stores the following data:
* **User IDs:** Your unique Discord User ID.
* **Minecraft Data:** Your Minecraft Username and unique UUID.
* **Message Content:** Messages sent in channels designated for "Minecraft-Discord" chat synchronization may be processed and forwarded to the game server console and logged in server files.
* **Role Data:** Information regarding your current roles in the Discord server to sync with in-game ranks.

### 2. How We Use Your Information
We use your data strictly for the operation of Pantheon Realms:
* **Authentication:** To verify you are the owner of the Minecraft account you are playing on.
* **Synchronization:** To automatically update your in-game rank based on your Discord roles (and vice versa).
* **Moderation:** To maintain logs of chat interactions for moderation purposes and to prevent abuse.

### 3. Data Storage
* **Location:** Data is stored locally on the physical or virtual server hosting the Pantheon Realms Minecraft instance.
* **Access:** Access to this data is restricted to the Administrator/Owner of Pantheon Realms and is not publicly accessible.
* **Database:** Linkage data is stored in the server's local file system (YAML) or a secured database (MySQL/SQLite).

### 4. Third-Party Sharing
We do not sell, trade, or transfer your data to outside parties. Your data is only shared with:
* **Discord Inc.:** As inherent to the functioning of any Discord Bot (via the Discord API).
* **Mojang/Microsoft:** As inherent to the functioning of a Minecraft Server (via UUID lookup).

### 5. Data Retention & Deletion
* **Retention:** Linkage data is retained as long as your account remains linked to Pantheon Realms.
* **Deletion:** You may remove your linkage data by unlinking your account (typically via the `/discord unlink` command in-game or in Discord).
    * *Note: Server logs (chat history) containing your messages may be retained indefinitely for moderation history and security audits.*
